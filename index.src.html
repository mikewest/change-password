    managers the ability to automatically change a user's password.

Introduction {#intro}
=====================

TODO(mkwst): Put an introduction here.

Goals {#goals}
--------------

1.  Password managers should be able to respond to breach reports by
    changing a user's password directly, rather than prompting a user
    to do it themselves.

2.  Password changes should be possible in a completely automated fashion,
    without depending on heuristics to detect password change forms, or
    (worse) on manually coded mechanisms for every origin.

3.  Any password manager should be able to make use of the functionality,
    without necessitating a deep integration between products.

4.  Accounts protected by second-factor authentication mechanisms should
    be able to reauthenticate a user before their password is changed.

Framework {#framework}
======================

At a high level, the mechanism in this document boils down to the following:

1.  An origin hosts a discovery manifest at `/.well-known/password`, which
    contains metadata which both asserts that passwords stored for this origin
    are capable of being changed automatically, and defines parameters which
    a password manager will use when making a change request.

2.  Once a password manager has verified that an origin's passwords can be
    automatically changed, it may do so by sending a `PUT` request to
    `/.well-known/password/change` which contains the user's current username
    and password tuple, along with the new password.

Discovery {#discovery}
----------------------

In order to assert that passwords for an origin are automatically changable, a
conformant server MUST serve a <dfn export>password change automation
manifest</dfn> which password managers retrieve by sending a `GET` request to
the well-known URL `/.well-known/password`.

The manifest MUST be delivered as a response whose status code is `200`, content
type is `application/json`, and body is equivalent to the result of executing
{{JSON.stringify()}} on a {{PasswordChangeAutomation}} dictionary:

<pre class="idl">
    dictionary PasswordChangeAutomation {
      boolean passwordChangeAutomationSupported = true;
      DOMString title;
      USVString failureURL;
    };
</pre>

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to support password change automation for accounts used
  on `https://accounts.example.com/`. It informs password managers that the
  change mechanism described in this document is supported by placing the
  following file at `https://accounts.example.com/.well-known/password`:

  <pre>
    {
      "<a dict-member>passwordChangeAutomationSupported</a>: true,
      "<a dict-member>title</a>: "MegaCorp, Inc.",
      "<a dict-member>failureURL</a>: "https://accounts.google.com/failed-change/"
    }
  </pre>
</div>

Ideas
=====

It would be bad if automation meant that attackers could trivially modify all
the passwords for all the users caught up in password dumps. We could harden
this mechanism in a few ways:

1.  Extend the credential management API to accept a public key along with
    credential storage. The server would generate a keypair when calling
    `store()`, hand the public key to the password manager without storing it,
    and store the private key in some secure way. When requesting a password
    change, the client would encrypt the password change request using the
    public key, and the server would decrypt using the private key.

    The upside is mitigation of dragnet password changes. The downside is that
    key management is hard.

2.  Moar?
